```bash  
    // First DB username
    1DB_USER =

    1DB_PORT =

    // First DB name
    1DB_DATABASE = "epaphroditesdb.sqlite"

    1DB_SOCKET = false

    // First DB socket
    1DB_SOCKET_PATH = ""

    // First DB host
    1DB_HOST = "127.0.0.1" 

    // First DB DRIVER - accepted : mysql/oracle/pgsql/sqlserver/sqlite/mongodb/redis
    1DB_DIVER = "sqlite"

```

### 💾 Create database

> Run this command to create your database
```bash  
php heredia create:db epaphroditesdb
```

### 💾 update database driver

```bash  
php heredia update:driver
```

#### Install python component
- Note: This command is intended for users who have previously installed Python on their machine. It simplifies the installation of specific Python libraries essential for the optimal functioning of the Epaphrodites framework. Furthermore, you have the freedom, at your level, to integrate other libraries according to the requirements of your projects :

```bash  
php heredia pip:component
```

### 🔥 Run your App
- Note: For SQL databases, you must create your database before running your application. In the case of MongoDB, the system will generate your database based on your configuration.

> Run server
```bash  
cd your_project
php heredia run:server --port=8000
```

> Authentification access
```bash  
Login : admin
Password : admin
