            "Epaphrodites-Framework uses Composer to manage its dependencies. Therefore, you need to first install Composer on your machine. After you have installed composer, you may create a new Epaphrodites project via the Composer create-project command : <pre class='code'>composer create-project --prefer-dist epaphrodites/epaphrodites project-name</pre> Now If MongoDB is not installed on your machine, we recommend removing the mongodb/mongodb line from your composer.json file. This will prevent errors during the framework installation. Or run this command : <pre class='code'>composer update create-project --prefer-dist --ignore-platform-req=ext-mongodb epaphrodites/epaphrodites your-project-name</pre>Continue the installation by doing :<pre class='code'>composer update</pre>If mongodb is not installing :<pre class='code'>composer update --ignore-platform-req=ext-mongodb</pre><pre class='code'>composer dump-autoload</pre>"
